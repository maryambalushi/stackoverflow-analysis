# Stack Overflow Developer Insights Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to explore the relationship between developers' education levels, coding experience, and learning preferences using Stack Overflow survey data. 

## Objectives
The following key questions were explored in the analysis:

1. How does education level impact years of coding experience?
2. What is the most common education level among experienced developers?
3. How do developers with different education levels prefer to learn?

## Dataset
- The dataset used is the Stack Overflow Developer Survey.
- Key columns analyzed: `EdLevel`, `YearsCodePro`, `LearnCodeOnline`.

## Results Summary
- Developers with higher education levels generally have more years of coding experience.
- Bachelor's and Master's degrees are the most common among experienced developers.
- The most preferred learning resources across all education levels are technical documentation, blogs, and written tutorials.

## Repository Contents
